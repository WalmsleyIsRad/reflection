# End of Third Week
## 9/22/2017
I learned about a network. Networks are more than just between two computers. It can also occur between two people, two families, two countries, etc. I learned how to encrypt messages using two different methods of encryption. I learned that encryption was used during WWII to crack the codes sent from Germany or the U.S. or anywhere so the U.S., for example, could understand the Germans' next move. I also learned the internet is not secure because of encryption errors that could happen when sending data to another computer. I got to encrypt some codes using the caesar method and other methods.
